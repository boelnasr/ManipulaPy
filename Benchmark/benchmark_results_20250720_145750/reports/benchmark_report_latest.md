## Recommendations

### When to Use GPU Acceleration:
- Large trajectory point counts (>1000 points)
- Multiple joint configurations (>6 joints)
- Batch processing multiple trajectories
- Real-time applications requiring low latency

### When to Use CPU:
- Small problem sizes (<500 points, <6 joints)
- Single trajectory computations
- Limited GPU memory scenarios
- Development and debugging

### Optimization Tips:
1. Use batch processing for multiple trajectories
2. Consider GPU memory limitations for very large problems
3. Profile your specific use case for optimal performance
4. Utilize adaptive thresholding in OptimizedTrajectoryPlanning
