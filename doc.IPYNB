    "# Screw Axis Theory in Robotics\n",
    "\n",
    "Screw axis theory is a fundamental concept in robotics and mechanical engineering, providing a powerful framework for describing and analyzing the motion of rigid bodies in three-dimensional space. This theory is particularly useful in the context of robotic manipulators, where understanding and controlling the motion of joints and links is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Screw Axis\n",
    "\n",
    "A screw motion in three-dimensional space can be thought of as a combination of a rotation about an axis and a translation along the same axis. This concept is encapsulated in the screw axis, which is defined by the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Axis of Rotation**: A line in space about which the rotation occurs.\n",
    "- **Angle of Rotation**: The magnitude of rotation about the axis.\n",
    "- **Direction of Translation**: The direction along the axis in which the translation occurs.\n",
    "- **Magnitude of Translation**: The distance moved along the axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representation of Screw Axis\n",
    "\n",
    "In robotics, the screw axis is often represented as a 6-dimensional vector, known as a twist. The twist vector combines the angular velocity (representing rotation) and linear velocity (representing translation) of a rigid body:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{T} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\omega \\\\ v \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\omega$ is a 3-dimensional vector representing the angular velocity.\n",
    "- $v$ is a 3-dimensional vector representing the linear velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Twist Expression in Terms of Screw Axis\n",
    "\n",
    "The twist vector associated with motion about a screw axis can be expressed in terms of the screw axis parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unit Vector ( $\\hat{s}$ )**: A unit vector along the screw axis, representing the direction of the axis.\n",
    "- **Point on the Axis \\( $q$ \\)**: A point through which the screw axis passes.\n",
    "- **Screw Pitch \\( $h$ \\)**: The ratio of translation to rotation along the screw axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these parameters and an angular velocity  $\\theta_{\\dot{}}$ about the screw axis, the twist $V$ can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V = \\begin{bmatrix} \\omega \\\\ v \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\hat{s} \\theta_{\\dot{}} \\\\ (q \\times \\hat{s}) \\theta_{\\dot{}} + h \\hat{s} \\theta_{\\dot{}} \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "-  $\\omega$ = $\\hat{s}$ $\\theta_{\\dot{}}$  is the angular velocity component of the twist, representing rotation about the screw axis.\n",
    "- $v$ = -$\\hat{s}$ $\\theta_{\\dot{}}$   $\\times$ $q$ + $h$ $\\hat{s}$ $\\theta_{\\dot{}}$  is the linear velocity component of the twist, representing translation along the screw axis.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Exponential and Logarithm\n",
    "- **Matrix Exponential (`MatrixExp6`)**: Converts a twist (screw axis representation) into a transformation matrix, which is used to describe the pose of a rigid body.\n",
    "- **Matrix Logarithm (`MatrixLog6`)**: The inverse operation, used to convert a transformation matrix back into a twist.\n",
    "\n",
    "These mathematical tools are key to applying screw theory in practical robotics applications, enabling the conversion between different representations of motion and facilitating the computation of robot dynamics and kinematics.\n"
